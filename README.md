## Linguistics Analysis for Research

Description
===========

Analyze corpora of texts (e.g., news media articles, speeches) to see trends in keyword usage, salience and context over time. 

Features include: 
- Import content from multiple sources into single dataframe object
- Text preprocessing (remove punctuation, lowercase, remove numbers, calculate date from M, D, Y fields)
- Count keywords in each document
- Determine presence and extent of frame (looks for a match in a list of keywords)
- Aggregate keywords/frames into time-series (e.g., annual or quarterly count of keyword)
- Explore collocations (bigram and trigrams) of keywords to understand their context, as well as collocation scores (log likelihood or PMI) 
- Count most common words in entire corpus
